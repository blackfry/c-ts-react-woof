# Assignment

Create a React app written in TypeScript to display random dogs using the following API:

https://random.dog/woof.json

* The app should present 8 results on the screen.
* Use a responsive fixed width layout.
* For desktop there should be 4 results to a row.
* For mobile there should be 1 result per row.
* There should be a button to allow the user to fetch another 8 dogs.
* The app should support common formats such as jpg, gif, png and mp4 results (if you encounter any totally random file types like psd just ignore that result and fetch another in its place)
* Use git for version control.
* Push your finished solution and full commit history to Github.
* Please include some tests. Use your judgement on what an appropriate amount of tests are, we are not looking for 100% test coverage.
* Include a brief Readme with instructions how to run the application and any other extra info or assumptions made that you would like to call out
* Bonus marks for a TravisCI (or similar) build

# Requirements
